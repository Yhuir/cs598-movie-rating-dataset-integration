# Curating a Multi-Source Dataset for Film Industry Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end data curation workflow for integrating
movie metadata and ratings from **TMDb**, **IMDb**, and **Rotten Tomatoes / OMDb**
into a unified, analysis-ready dataset.

The curated dataset is designed to support questions such as:

- How do critic and audience ratings differ across platforms and genres?
- Is there a measurable relationship between financial success and critical reception?
- Which movie categories show the strongest divergence between critic and audience sentiment?

The project implements the full data lifecycle introduced in CS598:
**acquisition, quality assessment, cleaning, integration, modeling, metadata, and documentation**.
All steps are implemented as modular Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
